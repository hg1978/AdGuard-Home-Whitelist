# AdGuard-Home-Whitelist

There are always pros and cons to use whitelists. I started with Pihole, but now I have AdGuard Home. Overblocking is not a permanent solution either. That's why I started to create a whitelist for AdGuard Home. My thanks also go to anudeep/ND whose whitelist I used as the basis for mine. Cheers!
If you have remaks or wishes please feel free to contact me.

UPDATE Dec 19, 2019

For me at least, the new CNAME cloaking has an effect on legitimate domains and therefore generates "false positives". For me it concerns iOS Apps as well as websites. I will update the whitelist when I see some false positive blockings.
